</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>This contract will be in charge of custodian registration and voting for candidates. It will also contain a function which could be called periodically to update the custodian set, and allocate payments.</p>
<p>When a candidate registers, they need to provide a set of configuration variables which will include things like their requested pay. The system will select the median requested pay when choosing the actual pay. The mean pay is to be paid to elected custodians at the end of each period. If an elected custodian resigns via the <code>withdrawcand</code> during a period a new candidate will be chosen to fill the gap on the custodian board from the votes ranking in the candidates at that moment.</p>
<p>Eg. 12 custodians are elected and their median <code>requestedpay</code> is 100 EOSDAC If one of the custodians resigns partially through a period they will not be paid for that partial period. The mean pay amount will be calculated based on the current elected custodians <code>requestedpay</code> value. If a candidate changes their requested pay it will not be included in the pay calculation until the next period if they are re-elected.</p>
<p>All of the active actions require a <code>dac_id (account_name)</code> parameter to be passed which is used to scope the DAC. This is the mechanism that the contracts use to facilitate hosting multiple DACs within the same codebase and enables all of these DACs to get all the future software updates instantly without having to copy and deploy their own version of the contract code.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md122"></a>
votecuste</h2>
<p>This action is to facilitate voting for candidates to become custodians of the DAC. Each member will be able to vote a configurable number of custodians set by the contract configuration. When a voter calls this action either a new vote will be recorded or the existing vote for that voter will be modified. If an empty array of candidates is passed to the action an existing vote for that voter will be removed.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md123"></a>
Assertions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The voter account performing the action is authorised to do so.</li>
<li>The voter account performing has agreed to the latest member terms for the DAC.</li>
<li>The number of candidates in the newvotes vector is not greater than the number of allowed votes per voter as set by the contract config.</li>
<li>Ensure there are no duplicate candidates in the voting vector.</li>
<li>Ensure all the candidates in the vector are registered and active candidates.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md124"></a>
Parameters:</h3>
<pre class="fragment">voter     - The account id for the voter account.
newvotes  - A vector of account ids for the candidate that the voter is voting for.
dac_id (name) - for DAC scoping
</pre><h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md125"></a>
Post Condition:</h4>
<p>An active vote record for the voter will have been created or modified to reflect the newvotes. Each of the candidates will have their total_votes amount updated to reflect the delta in voter's token balance. Eg. If a voter has 1000 tokens and votes for 5 candidates, each of those candidates will have their total_votes value increased by 1000. Then if they change their votes to now vote 2 different candidates while keeping the other 3 the same there would be a change of -1000 for 2 old candidates +1000 for 2 new candidates and the other 3 will remain unchanged.</p>
<hr  />
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md127"></a>

<li>the supplied asset symbol matches the current lockup symbol if it has been previously set or that there have been no .</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>lockupasset(uint8_t) : defines the asset and amount required for a user to register as a candidate. This is the amount that will be locked up until the user calls <code>withdrawcand</code> in order to get the asset returned to them. If there are currently already registered candidates in the contract this cannot be changed to a different asset type because of introduced complexity of handling the staked amounts.</li>
<li>maxvotes(asset) : Defines the maximum number of candidates a user can vote for at any given time.</li>
<li>numelected(uint16_t) : The number of candidates to elect for custodians. This is used for the payment amount to custodians for median amount.</li>
<li>periodlength(uint32_t) : The length of a period in seconds. This is used for the scheduling of the deferred <code>newperiod</code> actions at the end of processing the current one. Also is used as part of the partial payment to custodians in the case of an elected custodian resigning which would also trigger a <code>newperiod</code> action.</li>
<li>initial_vote_quorum_percent (uint32) : The percent of voters required to activate the DAC for the first election period.</li>
<li>vote_quorum_percent (uint32) : The percent of voters required to continue the DAC for the following election periods after the first one has activated the DAC.</li>
<li>auth_threshold_high (uint8) : The number of custodians required to approve an action in the high permission category (exceptional change).</li>
<li>auth_threshold_mid (uint8) : The number of custodians required to approve an action in the mid permission category ( extraordinary change).</li>
<li>auth_threshold_low (uint8) : The number of custodians required to approve an action in the low permission category ( ordinary action such as a worker proposal).</li>
<li>dac_id (name) - for DAC scoping</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md140"></a>
newperiode</h2>
<p>This action is to be run to end and begin each period in the DAC life cycle. It performs multiple tasks for the DAC including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocate custodians from the candidates tables based on those with most votes at the moment this action is run. &ndash; This action removes and selects a full set of custodians each time it is successfully run selected from the candidates with the most votes weight. If there are not enough eligible candidates to satisfy the DAC config numbers the action adds the highest voted candidates as custodians as long their votes weight is greater than 0. At this time the held stake for the departing custodians is set to have a time delayed lockup to prevent the funds from releasing too soon after each custodian has been in office.</li>
<li>Distribute pay for the existing custodians based on the configs into the pending pay table so it can be claimed by individual candidates. &ndash; The pay is distributed as determined by the median pay of the currently elected custodians. Therefore all elected custodians receive the same pay amount.</li>
<li>Set the DAC auths for the intended controlling accounts based on the configs thresholds with the newly elected custodians. This action asserts unless the following conditions have been met:</li>
<li>The action cannot be called multiple times within the period since the last time it was previously run successfully. This minimum time between allowed calls is configured by the period length parameter in contract configs.</li>
<li>To run for the first time a minimum threshold of voter engagement must be satisfied. This is configured by the&#160;<code>initial_vote_quorum_percent</code>&#160;field in the contract config with the percentage calculated from the amount of registered votes cast by voters against the max supply of tokens for DAC's primary currency.</li>
<li>After the initial vote quorum percent has been reached subsequent calls to this action will require a minimum of&#160;<code>vote_quorum_percent</code>&#160;to vote for the votes to be considered sufficient to trigger a new period with new custodians.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md170"></a>
Compile</h1>
<p>The contract code has some compile time constants used for configuration. As a compile time constant the code has more flexibility for reuse on other DACs, and an extra layer of safety over exposing another configuration variable which could be changed after the code has been set and the ability to unit test the code without needing to modify the source just for testing. The available compile time flags are:</p>
<ul>
<li>TOKENCONTRACT (default = "eosdactokens") - This is to set the associated token contract to inter-operate with for tracking voting weights, registered members and staking.</li>
<li>VOTING_DISABLED (default = false) - Setting this flag will disable the ability for anyone to vote for custodians by disabling the vote action.</li>
<li>TRANSFER_DELAY (default = 60 * 60) - for configuring the time delay on token transfers from the contract</li>
</ul>
<p>When put all together a compile command with all the bells and whistles might look like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">eosio-cpp -DTRANSFER_DELAY=3600 -DVOTING_DISABLED -o daccustodian.wasm daccustodian.cpp</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note:</b> Since there are default values for the above flags they do not all need to be included to compile successfully. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md172"></a>
Tests</h1>
<p>The tests have been re-written to run with lamington in typescript. This provides a much better type-safety since the typescript objects that intereact with the contract and generated from the installed contract ABI and the test actions run through EOSJS which is a more common real life usecase than using <code>cleos</code> as the ruby tests were doing.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md173"></a>
Installation</h3>
<p>Due to some customisations I have made to Lamington to suit my needs to tests use a local version of Lamington which is hosted in EOSDAC at <a href="https://github.com/eosdac/lamington">https://github.com/eosdac/lamington</a>. The changes will soon be updated so it can run via a normal npm install either original Lamington source or via a forked npm module. In the mean time check out Lamington locally from EOSDAC and run the local version as if a Lamington contributer would using npm link (further docs for this are available in the Lamington docs)</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md174"></a>
Run the tests from the project root with:</h3>
<p>``<code>bash </code>npm run-script test verbose<code> </code>`` </p>
